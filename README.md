# Classic-Wood-Crafting

## What is this pack about?
It restores the old wood crafting recipe (all logs=oak planks, 3 planks=6 **Petrified** Slabs), and adds compatibility with modern slab-requiring recipes

## But *why?*
Why *NOT?* It's a feature Nostalgic Tweaks lacks by default, so I figured I should add it. :P
